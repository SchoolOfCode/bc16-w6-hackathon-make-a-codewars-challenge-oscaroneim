## **_CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS_**

**_FOR YOUR EYES ONLY_**

Date: March 14th 1967.

Mission: Reverse engineering.

Brief:

A man by the name of Jack Kilby, is working on a top secret project. The message we intercepted said that the device being worked on, can produce instantaneous results to mathematical equations when numbers are passed into it! We also uncovered that you can fit all that computing power in your pocket!

Your task is to reproduce the device.

## OBJECTIVES

Unfortunately we couldn't decipher the rest of the message but what we did find is that the device takes in a max of 3 arguments:

1)operator

2)integer 1

3)integer 2

We know that is uses at least 4 mathematical operators. But we want to improve on this. We need our device to calculate:

• addition

• subtraction

• multiplication

• division

• if the number is Odd or Even

(This method only uses one value)

• the square root of a number

(This method only uses one value Hint square root = "sqrt")

**!WARNING PLEASE SEE!**

**_You must factor in that the machine is not allowed to divide by zero returning an exact message of "Division by zero error"_**

**_If the operator entered is invalid, YOU MUST RETURN an exact message of 'Invalid operator'._**

We will provide you with example calculations and their expected results to test if your machine works.

Good Luck.

## Set up

• Clone down the files to begin

• npm install

• Once installed use **_npm t_** to run the tests.
